# Mono Road Map

I plan to keep pourint this repo with more goodies overtime. Here are some of them.

## Monorepo governance

- Update monorepo to only build and test whatever necessary (changes)

## Utilities

- TS-Utils => simple TS utility that is typesafe but relatively "simple" to read/understand. This take inspirations from FP-ish Language.
- UI Kit wrapper

## App

- Merge my personal website here.
